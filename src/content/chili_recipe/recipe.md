## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Base
1. Heat a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat
2. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and no longer pink (about 6-8 minutes)
3. Drain excess fat, leaving about 2 tablespoons in the pot

### Step 2: Build the Flavor
1. Add diced onions to the pot with the beef and cook until softened (about 5 minutes)
2. Add bell peppers and cook for another 3-4 minutes
3. Stir in garlic and jalape単os, cook for 1 minute until fragrant
4. Add tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly

### Step 3: Add Spices
1. Add all the spices (chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, and cayenne)
2. Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant
3. Pour in the beer (if using) and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot

### Step 4: Simmer the Chili
1. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, and apple cider vinegar
2. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low
3. Cover partially and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally
4. Add the beans and continue simmering for another 30-45 minutes
5. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed

### Step 5: Final Touches
1. Remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes before serving
2. The chili will thicken as it cools slightly

## Tips for Success

**Make it ahead**: Chili tastes even better the next day! Make it a day in advance and reheat when ready to serve.

**Customize the heat**: Adjust the cayenne pepper and jalape単os to your preferred spice level. You can also add hot sauce to individual bowls.

**Thickening**: If your chili is too thin, simmer uncovered for the last 15-20 minutes. If it's too thick, add more beef broth.

**Storage**: Refrigerate for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months.

**Variations**: Try adding corn, diced tomatoes, or different types of beans. You can also substitute ground turkey or add chunks of beef for variety.
