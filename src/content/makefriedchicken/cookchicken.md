## Ingredients

### For the Chicken
- 1 whole chicken (3-4 lbs), cut into 8 pieces
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

### For the Coating
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 teaspoons black pepper
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)

### For Frying
- 6-8 cups vegetable oil (or enough for deep frying)

## Equipment
- Large bowl for marinating
- Large heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer
- Wire rack
- Meat thermometer
- Paper towels

## Instructions

### Step 1: Marinate the Chicken
1. In a large bowl, combine buttermilk, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.
2. Add chicken pieces to the buttermilk mixture, ensuring all pieces are well coated.
3. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight (up to 24 hours).

### Step 2: Prepare the Coating
1. In a large shallow dish, whisk together flour, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and cayenne pepper.
2. Mix thoroughly to ensure even distribution of spices.

### Step 3: Heat the Oil
1. Pour oil into a heavy-bottomed pot, filling it about 1/3 full.
2. Heat oil to 350°F (175°C). Use a thermometer to monitor temperature.
3. Maintain this temperature throughout cooking.

### Step 4: Coat the Chicken
1. Remove chicken from buttermilk marinade, allowing excess to drip off.
2. Dredge each piece thoroughly in the seasoned flour mixture.
3. Press the coating firmly into the chicken to ensure it adheres well.
4. Place coated pieces on a wire rack and let sit for 10-15 minutes to set the coating.

### Step 5: Fry the Chicken
1. Carefully add chicken pieces to the hot oil, a few at a time to avoid overcrowding.
2. Fry larger pieces (thighs, breasts) for 12-15 minutes.
3. Fry smaller pieces (wings, drumsticks) for 8-10 minutes.
4. Turn pieces halfway through cooking for even browning.
5. Chicken is done when internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) and coating is golden brown.

### Step 6: Drain and Rest
1. Remove fried chicken from oil using tongs or a slotted spoon.
2. Place on a wire rack over paper towels to drain excess oil.
3. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

## Tips for Perfect Fried Chicken

- **Temperature Control**: Maintain oil temperature between 325-350°F. Too hot and the outside burns before the inside cooks; too cool and the chicken becomes greasy.
- **Don't Overcrowd**: Fry in batches to maintain oil temperature and ensure even cooking.
- **Double Dredge**: For extra crispy coating, dip coated chicken back into buttermilk and flour mixture once more.
- **Rest the Coating**: Letting the coated chicken sit helps the breading adhere better during frying.
- **Use a Thermometer**: The most reliable way to check doneness is with a meat thermometer.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve your crispy fried chicken with:
- Mashed potatoes and gravy
- Coleslaw
- Biscuits and honey
- Mac and cheese
- Corn on the cob
- Pickles

## Storage

- **Refrigerator**: Store leftover fried chicken in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
- **Reheating**: Reheat in a 375°F oven for 10-15 minutes to restore crispiness.
